# sqlalchemy-challenge

In this challenge, I conducted a climate analysis for Honolulu, Hawaii. I did this using SQLAlchemy ORM, Flask, and Json aspects. I performed CRUD operatons to inspect, reflect, and query data to retrieve relevant information, and used Flask and Json aspects to return results from API endpoints.

I used code gained from class lecture, class materials, and the class Xpert Learning Assistant.
